// list of photo albums to view
// albums can be either a set of images or a single webcam image
//
// with a set of photos this will randomly cycle through them
// with a single webcam image it will reload the current image

// list is the location of a text file that contains "name" as the first line,
//       and then a list of image filenames to show, one per line
// location gives the root directory of the images listed in list
// name is what to name the button in the user interface for this album

// as an example the chi album reads the webcam3.txt file which has the name of a 
//       single image to reload from the URL given in location: http://cdn.abclocal.go.com/three/wls/webcam/"
//name
//Loopscape.jpg
//
// whereas the photos.txt file for the sage album contains a list of images
//name
//addedsince2011/_LJL0075.jpg
//addedsince2011/_LJL0388.jpg
//addedsince2011/_LJL0408.jpg

// the images can be stored in the same location as the text file with the list of images
// or they can be stored in different URLs
